/**
 * A few things to note here:
 * 
 * >The Serializers use reflection because otherwise I have to make the General
 * Recipe Type non-Abstract, and that would kind of ruin the point of them
 * 
 * >Some things may seem a little excessive now, but that's because I have done
 * some future-proofing and made things easier on future me. If we want to add
 * some more advanced features to recipes, it's a whole hell of a lot easier to
 * do so this way. (i.e. xp, nbt, ect.)
