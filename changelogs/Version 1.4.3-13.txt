Version 1.4.3 build 13
- Make max energy code shorter.
- Update energy cable render so that it can support multiple types and not just copper.
- Fix energy cable lighting issues.
- Update energy cable recipes and add 4 different kinds. Copper, silver, gold and superconductive.
- Update blocklead texture. Has custom png.
- Make blocklead texture brighter.
- Add silver ore
- Add silver ingot
- Update measurement class. Add integervalue method.
- Add more flexibility to the electricitydisplay. Can now show energy per tick
- Optimize energy convertion.
- Add dynamic support for fake inventory containers. Aka ones with no custom slots.
- Add custom text to the energy cables.
- Add superconductive ingot.
- Add superconductive blend.
- Optimize and change centrifuge model and texture.
- Optimize and change chemical boiler model and texture.
- Fix lead ore texture. Had the wrong colours.
- Add a reactor control panel. This can be placed as a part of the lead encasement.
- Add custom texture for the reactor control panel where it turns on and off.
- Fix tin ore texture so it is brighter.
- Change wrench texture.
- Make energy cable textures darker.
- Add usage text to centrifuge gui.
- Add usage text to chemical boiler gui.
- Add usage text to chemical extractor gui.
- Switch places for temperature and time left text in the fission reactor gui.
- Fix usage text in the particle accelerator gui so it shows per tick.
- Add reactor control panel gui.
- Fix some minor bugs in the centrifuge NEI recipe handler.
- Update spin for the centrifuge so it stays at the rotation it was at when it looses power.
- Fix electromagnet meta data placement.
- Make centrifuge gui bigger.
- Make chemical boiler gui bigger.
- Make chemical extractor gui bigger.
- Update chemical boiler power usage to 750 watts.
- Update chemical extractor power usage to 750 watts.
- Made the reactor encasement check faster.
- Update fusion reactor power usage to 125.0 Kilowatts
- Update gas centrifuge power usage to 1.5 Kilowatts.
- Optimize the insertable control rod gui creation.
- Update particle accelerator power usage to 169.5 Kilowatts.
- Update quantum assembler power usage to 35.5 Kilowatts.
- Add custom reactor control panel tileentity.
- Fix crash when you wrenched energy cables.
- Add support for metadata when wrenching blocks.
- Update entire energy cable system so that instead of each cable carrying energy by themselves and moving that around to other cable the energy cables
now are a part of a bigger network that sends energy from a provider of energy to all the receivers.
- Optimize energy cables ALOT by using this new energy system. No longer updates energy cable tile entities at all.
- Add more checks for the canprocess method in the gas centrifuge.
- Add a multimeter which you can use to get energy network stats.  Right click on a cable to do this.
- Update all GUI'S in physica nuclear physics so that they show the proper amount of energy that is being used per tick.
- Update chemical boiler gui so it shows the proper amount of power used.
- Update chemical extractor gui so it shows the proper amount of power used.
- Update gas centrifuge gui so it shows the proper amount of power used.
- Update particle accelerator gui so it shows the proper amount of power used.
- Update Particle Accelerator gui show the used amount is now in WattHours.
- Fix unit system so you can actually see numbers with the prefix "Giga" and not just "Mega".
- Fix crash with rotating tiles.
- Add system wehre the centrifuge connects to the chemical boiler from the back. These tileentities now have proper input and output textures so you can see where to connect them.
- Gas Centrifuges will now autorotate to connected chemical boilers.
- Gas Centrifuges now take 2400 ticks to finish one item as in the older atomic science.
- Fix code where the chemical boiler progress bar used the centrifuges required_ticks. They are now separate. 
- Cleanup all code and add custom formatting so this will probably not change again.
