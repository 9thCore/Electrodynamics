Version 1.4.6 build 5

### Game Changes ###
Add a config option that allows you to modify other mods's visuals to use watt ticks instead of RF. This only works on mekanism currently and is on by default.
Decrease turbine max rf so it actually holds the max steam * energy and not the max value of an integer.
Optimize models themselves.
Add a battery box. This has three sub-blocks which is the "Battery Box", the Advanced "..." and the Elite "...".
Fix that the world was generating lead blocks instead of lead ore.
Fix bugs with the coal generator.
Add custom textures for all the machines. They now use a set of defaults plus whatever they use that is different.
Add an electric furnace. This works the same as a normal furnace except that it is faster and uses electricity to run
Remove wattticks from the waila integration.
Optimize model rendering.
Separate wattticks into watt ticks. This also applies to watt seconds and watt hours.
Improve quantum cell texture.
Improve electromagnetic cell texture.
Improve steel ingot texture. Made it darker.

### Code Changes ###
Remove useless code in the CommonProxy.java
Move all source code in the old src/main and separate it. Now there are two new folders, src/core and src/resources.
Stop using ForgeDirection.class in all the places that we can. We now use the custom 'Face.java' This is because of the changes in future MC versions.
Stop using X,Y,Z in all the tileentities that we can. We now use the custom Location class. This is because of the changes in future MC versions.
Stopped accessing worldObj directly. This is also an "abstraction" layer to the old code.
Stopped using the tessellator in most classes and we now use a wrapper for it. This is also an "abstraction" layer to the old code.
Add a custom model loader so that we can continue to use obj models in the future.
Add an abstraction layer for sides in sided inventories.
Remove massive amounts of code frop the javax.vecmath api. We dont need this here? Only used once. Changed to Vector3f's from elsewhere.
Made packet ids more consistant.
Move relative rotation stuff into the face class itself.
Remove parts of the cofhcore api as we dont need it.
